1. EC2PrimeDeployRole is an IAM role assigned to EC2 instances that allows them to interact 
with AWS services as part of the deployment process. It needs S3 permissions because 
AWS CodeDeploy tyically stores application artifacts in an S3 bucket, ergo the EC2 instance 
must retrieve these artifacts from S3 to deploy and execute the application properly.

2. It defines how CodeDeploy is suppposed to manage the deployment lifecycle.
It includes hooks that specify scripts or commands to run at different stages of the
deployment process. 

3. If it were in a private subnet, it would either need a NAT Gateway/NAT Instance or
VPC Endpoints for S3 and CodeDeploy
